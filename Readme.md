# OpenManus

OpenManus is an open-source initiative that aims to build a robust agent ecosystem capable of harnessing various powerful tools—such as the MCP tool base and web browsing—to achieve sophisticated reasoning and execution. We draw inspiration from existing works like **OSWorld**, **open-interpretor**, and more. **Code coming soon**!

# Roadmap
1. Web Environment Support
Integrate the ability to browse the web and interact with external resources seamlessly.

2. Advanced Reasoning Models
Connect to specialized reasoning models such as deepseek-r1 for more complex inference tasks.

3. Test on Agent Benchmarks
Evaluate our framework on agentic benchmark such as Webshop, GAIA, OSWorld, AgentBench

4. RL-Tuning Model Paradigm
Provide an RL fine-tuning approach for customizing the agent’s behavior in various real-world applications.
