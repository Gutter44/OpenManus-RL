# OpenManus-RL

OpenManus-RL is an open-source initiative collaboratively led by **Ulab-UIUC** and **MetaGPT**.

This project is an extended version of the original [@OpenManus](https://github.com/mannaandpoem/OpenManus) initiative. Inspired by successful RL tunning for reasoning LLM such as Deepseek-R1, QwQ-32B, we will explore new paradigms for RL-based LLM agent tuning, particularly building upon foundations.

We are committed to regularly updating our exploration directions and results in a dynamic, live-streaming fashion. All progress, including rigorous testing on agent benchmarks such as GAIA, AgentBench, WebShop, and OSWorld, and tuned models, will be openly shared and continuously updated.

We warmly welcome contributions from the broader community—join us in pushing the boundaries of agent reasoning and tool integration!

Code and dataset coming soon! Stay tuned!

# Roadmap
1. Agent Environment Support
Setting up LLM agent environment for online RL tunning.

2. Agent Trajectories Data Collection
Connect to specialized reasoning models such as deepseek-r1, QwQ-32B for more complex inference tasks to collect comprehensive agent trajectories.

3. RL-Tuning Model Paradigm
Provide an RL fine-tuning approach for customizing the agent’s behavior in our agent environment.

4. Test on Agent Benchmarks
Evaluate our framework on agentic benchmark such as Webshop, GAIA, OSWorld, AgentBench
